Hi, my name is  Zhu Rongfu. You can call me Jansen either. I majored in computer science during my campus time.

Since graduation, I have been working as a front-end developer for three years now. For the last half-year, I worked as o senior font-end developer in OpsMind. I applied with new solution to refactor the official site for graceful outlook and better performance. Im am fluent with JavaScript, CSS and React. Because of some personal reasons, I left OpsMind. I think I need more challenges, so I join Citi now.

In my spare time, I prefer to learn something new, for example, container service docker, open searching tool elastic search, design tool photoshop. In addtion, I am goot at Pingpong.On weekends, I cook delicious handmade noodles.

Ok, that's complete me. I value this chance to know you guys, and hopefully will be looking forward to collaborating with you fellows smoothly.
